<h1>My own training area</h1>

- This repo is my training area  where I build multiple, project agnostic features, microSystems, challenged ideas but all depending on the business needs (comming from the clients requirments from the freelancing platforms) without depending on one big project, The main goal of that approach to Rais my skills 

- Laravel -> Main Backend server . . . I tend to change to .NET later (super fast + interprise level)  
- MySql -> DB . . . I tend to change to postgree later (tons of featuers + interprise level too)
- Next.js(react) -> frontend web version of the app 
- Flutter -> frontend mobile version of the app 
- langchain/langgraph -> building complex AI system
- FastAPI -> server layer to expose the AI system as a microservices (even may play as the main backend server)
